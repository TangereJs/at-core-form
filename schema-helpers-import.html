<!--
  *ij* order or statements is important here
  at-elements import needs to happen first
  becase in schema-helepers.initializeCentralArrayOfComponents we use
  Polymer.telemetry.registrations to populate central array of components
  if at-elements import is after script import Polymer.telemetry.registrations is probably empty
  and then central array of components doesn't work
