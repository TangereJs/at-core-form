<!--
  see AT-44 to understand why this happened
  at-elements import can't be here anymore
  because at-core-propform imports at-core-form
  and at-core-form would import all at-elements

  since at-core-propform is used in form designer
  all elements would be imported everytime
  this is not acceptable because it incurrs high cost on performance

  The new way this has to be done is
  1) import the file which lists which elements you want to use on the form
  2) import the at-core-form
  3) profit
  <link rel="import" href="../at-elements/at-elements.html">

  so, each time you import at-core-propform you need to import
  elements you want at-core-propform to use
-->
<!--
  *ij* order or statements is important here
  at-elements import needs to happen first
  becase in schema-helepers.initializeCentralArrayOfComponents we use
  Polymer.telemetry.registrations to populate central array of components
  if at-elements import is after script import Polymer.telemetry.registrations is probably empty
  and then central array of components doesn't work
